# Data-engineering-project
In this project, I collected data from the Tiki website using API Endpoint. I also used the Random and Faker libraries to generate some data tables. <br />
After the data was transformed and processed, I loaded it into a SQLite database using the SQLite3 library. <br />
Next, I designed a data warehouse and created a data pipeline to transfer data from the database to the data warehouse. <br />
Finally, I used the Power BI tool to model the data into a dashboard for analysis and research purposes.

P1: web scraping <br />
P2: loading data <br />
P3: designing a datawarehouse <br />
P4: analyzing data with power BI <br />
